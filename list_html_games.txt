Copilot said: 1. **Bouncing Ball Game**
Bouncing Ball Game
A simple game where a ball bounces around the screen, and the player controls a paddle to keep the ball from falling off the bottom edge. The goal is to prevent the ball from falling as long as possible, with the speed increasing over time.

Catch the Falling Objects
Objects (like fruits or stars) fall from the top of the screen, and the player moves a basket or character horizontally to catch them. Points are awarded for each object caught, and the game ends if too many are missed.

Memory Flip Cards
An interactive memory game where cards are laid face down. The player clicks to flip two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The game tracks the number of moves, and animates the card flips.

Animated Maze Runner
The player controls a character (using arrow keys) navigating through a randomly generated maze. The character’s movement is smoothly animated, and there may be a timer or obstacles to add challenge.

Color Match Reaction
A fast-paced game where colored blocks or buttons appear and change color. The player must quickly click a matching button or area before time runs out. Animations highlight the correct choices and provide feedback for mistakes.

Whack-a-Mole
Moles pop up from random holes on the screen, and the player must quickly click or tap them before they disappear. The game tracks the player’s score and reaction speed, with lively animations for popping up and down.
